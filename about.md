Welcome to the course website for *Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases* being taught Spring 2020 at NC State. This course will focus on how phylogenetic and population genetic  methods are used to track the spread of infectious diseases using pathogen genomic data. We will explore how models and methods can be adapted to the epidemiology and natural history of different pathosystems, including viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens in plants, animals and humans.  Topics include reconstructing transmission networks, epidemic dynamics, spatial movement (phylogeography), recombination and adaptive evolution.  The final part of the course will focus on phylodynamics and how combining epidemic modeling with phylogenetics is giving molecular epidemiology increased power to track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens.

**Instructor:** [David Rasmussen][david-web] (<drasmus@ncsu.edu>)

**Listing:** PP 590/790

**Schedule:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 1:30-2:45pm

**Structure:** The course will meet twice per week. The first session will generally be a lecture or discussion. The second session will be tutorial-based and will give you the opportunity to apply methods to real data.  While no programming experience is assumed or required, a few tutorials will give you the option of writing your own Python/R code to analyze data and visualize results. Students will be evaluated based on in-class participation and a short written report based on an independent, team-based project analyzing a dataset of your choice.

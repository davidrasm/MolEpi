### What you will need:

-***Optional:*** Python 3.6 or later <br>

### Exploring infectious disease dynamics with SIR models

In this tutorial we will work with SIR models using Python in an interactive Jupyter notebook.

There are two ways you can run these notebooks:

### 1) Running Python/Jupyter on your own machine 

If you have previously installed the [Anaconda][anaconda] distribution of Python, then you should already have Jupyter and the other dependencies required for theses exercises. You can download the *SIR.ipynb* from [this GitHub repo][git-repo]. You can then run the notebook from the command line by executing:

```
jupyter notebook /path_to_file/SIR.ipynb
```

[anaconda]: <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>
[git-repo]: <https://github.com/davidrasm/SIR-binder.git>

### 2) Running a virtual environment with Binder

If you do not have Python or Jupyter installed, no worries, you can just use the Binder link below to run the *SIR.ipynb* notebook in a virtual environment that already has all of the Python dependencies installed.
